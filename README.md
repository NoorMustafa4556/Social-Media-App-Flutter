#  Social Media App (Flutter + Provider + Firebase)

A full-featured **social media application** built with Flutter and Firebase, featuring secure authentication, user profiles with follow/unfollow, posts and resharing, real-time likes/comments, dark/light mode, and clean state management via **Provider**. Built with clean architecture for scalability and maintainability.

---

##  Features

-  **User Authentication** â€“ Register, login, and maintain user sessions securely via Firebase.
-  **Profiles** â€“ Follow/unfollow users and update profile info including posts.
-  **Posting System** â€“ Create public/private posts with images.
-  **Reshare Mechanism** â€“ Reshare content across the app.
-  **Real-Time Interactions** â€“ Like and comment on posts instantly (real-time sync).
-  **Dark & Light Themes** â€“ Toggle between light and dark modes dynamically.
-  **State Management** â€“ Seamless state handling using the `provider` package.

##  Architectural Flow

1. **View** (UI) interacts through user actions (e.g., posting, liking).
2. **Provider (ViewModel)** processes logic and updates application state.
3. **Firebase Backend** manages authentication, Firestore for data, and Storage for media.
4. State changes flow back via Provider, triggering UI rebuilds for smooth user experience.
